        <p>After 60 years of lying idle, a field at the Kidston farm in Spryfield came to life in 1996,
        thanks to the determination and dedication of members of the Urban Farm Museum
        Society of Spryfield. With the help of a team of oxen and a tractor, and a large audience
        to cheer them on, the field was ploughed and a crop of oats was planted. It is part of three
        acres leased by the Urban Farm Museum Society of Spryfield from the Kidston family.</p>
        <p>This cleared field has been expanded over the years. Individual residents and local
        organizations, all members of the Urban Farm Museum Society of Spryfield, are reaping
        the benefits. They have been assigned plots to grow their own vegetables. This year, as
        part of the Come Grow With Us program which teaches children how to grow their own
        vegetables, an additional 12 plots have been added for children and their families.
        Volunteers help make the Urban Farm an important resource in our community. We
        welcome your help.</p>

        <p>The original Kidston Farm consisted of two 500-acre lots, numbers four and five,
        in Leiblin Manor. In the 1760s, nine Leiblin Manor lots were granted to prominent
        Halifax merchants who used them primarily as wood lots. Lot number four on which the
        Urban Farm field is situated was part of the l500 acres purchased and developed as a farm
        during the early 1770s by the industrious military engineer, Captain William Spry.
        Following Spry’s tenure, George McIntosh, Esquire, continued to operate it as a
        productive farm where beef and dairy cattle roamed and grain and root crops flourished.</p>
        <p>In 1822, William Kidston, Junior, purchased the 1000 acre farm from the George
        McIntosh estate and called it Thornhill. In spite of his limited experience as a farmer,
        Kidston built a homestead where he settled his large and increasing family. He added
        sheep to the inventory of farm animals and wool became another by-product of the
        Spryfield farm. In 1827, under Kidston’s supervision, Thornhill Farm produced large
        crops of wheat and other grains and 500 bushels of potatoes. Twenty tons of hay fed his
        livestock which consisted of “14 sheep, three horses, four swine and 12 horned cattle.”</p>
        <p>By 1832, however, William Kidston was ready to sell Thornhill farm. In a letter
        to his old and trusted friend and solicitor in Pictou, Abraham Patterson, he spoke of the
        pending sale and his plans to move his family and furniture to Pictou, the birthplace of
        his wife, Elizabeth Dawson. The farm did not sell and Kidston moved his family to a
        house in Halifax. He served as Sheriff for Halifax County. In 1834, an advertisement in
        the Royal Gazette offered for sale “that beautiful Farm at Spryfield...The arable land is
        deep, strong and productive...it is well watered by beautiful lakes and streams on which
        there are fine falls for water power mills; a capital situation for washing of wool on the
        skin or otherwise; a desirable place for establishing the manufacture of wool into yarn,
        cloth, etc; ...and has a very extensive range of superior pasturage, within secure fencing.”</p>
        <p>William Kidston died in 1836, however, leaving his wife and ten children (the
        youngest only two years old) with an estate which included Thornhill Farm and its
        outstanding mortgage, a house in Halifax in which the family resided, land in Country
        Harbour, Guysborough County, a lot at Tangier, Halifax County, and property in
        Scotland bequeathed to him by his late father. Before her death in 1846, Elizabeth
        Dawson Kidston, with the help of her brother-in-law, Richard Kidston, in Scotland, paid
        off the mortgage on the farm and conveyed it, in trust, to her 21year-old son, Archibald
        Glen, who eventually bought out the shares of his siblings and some of the landowners
        around him.</p>
        <p>Archibald Glen Kidston’s success as a farmer may be seen in subsequent records.
        By 1851 he had begun to rebuild the farm, producing 40 bushels of potatoes, 300 bushels
        of turnips, 4 bushels of other root crops, 16 bushels of hay, 10 bushels of wheat and 80
        bushels of oats. On the premises were two barns, five “milch” cows, one horse, six sheep
        and one pig. In 1865, listed in the business directory for Spryfield as a “Farmer and
        Dealer in Stock and Horses” was A. Kidston. Following his marriage to Mary Dart of
        Spryfield, seven sons and four daughters were born. With the help of his sons, the farm
        continued to thrive and two years before his death in 1894, he leased Thornhill Farm to
        his sons. At that time, the following animals were listed in the farm inventory: “three
        Horses, 12 Cows, one Bull, two Oxen, four Heffers, one Bull Calf, 30 Sheep, six Pigs,
        two Domestic Geese, one Wild Goose and 75 Hens.”</p>
        <p>Following the death of Archibald Glen Kidston, Thornhill Farm was divided into
        two separate farms between his sons, John and Archibald, Jr. Two more generations of
        Kidstons continued to farm their inheritance, albeit on a smaller scale than their
        predecessors. During the early 1900s, John Kidston operated the Rockingstone Dairy and
        his land became known as Rockingstone Farm on which the Kidston homestead and the
        Urban Farm Museum of Spryfield are now located. In 1928, before his death, John
        Kidston deeded part of his farm to his brother Arthur. In 1929, when John’s nephew,
        another John Kidston, returned from United States to inherit the present homestead and
        what remained of the Rockingstone Farm, the fields were still cleared for planting
        vegetables. The Kidston family continued to produce potatoes and other vegetables
        which, along with eggs and squab (pigeons), were sold to the residents of Halifax.
        Potatoes were always left in the fields for others less fortunate who were encouraged to
        dig them up for their own use.</p>
        <p>In 1941, John Kidston became active in war service and for four years production
        on the farm came to a standstill. The 1950s and 1960s saw more changes as a result of
        expropriation, and Rockingstone Farm was reduced to seven acres. Large scale farming
        in Spryfield was, indeed, a thing of the past.</p>
